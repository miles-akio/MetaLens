            <h2>Our Beginnings</h2>
            <p>Miles Shinmachi (pictured on the right), MetaLensâ€™ founder, always looked beyond to see technology grow to its fullest extent at a young age. When he went to his optometrist appointment and was told to wear glasses due to terrible vision, an idea sparked that would revolutionize the tech field forever, wearable technological glasses</p>

            <h2>Perserverance & Committment</h2>
            <p>After a few years of tinkering, Miles was able to create a prototype of what soon became the MetaLens Gen 1. However, many tried to replicate his genius product and had to fight in order to claim that the idea was originally his. In addition, upon testing the prototype, it malfunctioned countless times and Miles had to go back to the drawing board to troubleshoot and locate the point of issue.</p>

            <h2>The Present</h2>
            <p>After 2 years, Miles was able to buy many patents to state that this technology was his and was able to freely create his product without others replicating it. In addition, after re-evaluating, the MetaLens Gen 1 was finally finished and free of malfunctioning components. In addition, Miles was given a loan in order to scale up his business to the fullest and it has grown to what it is today </p>
